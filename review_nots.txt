Board is a battery powered temperature/humidtity logger that graphs temeperatures on an e-ink display

Has charger and fuel gauge (based on battery babysitter in references folder).

Has soft power switch latch IC that disables power path enable on the charger when killed by the 
MCU or if button is held down long enough. It also re-enables power when pressed again. It sents interrupts
to MCU for short presses.

ESP32-S3-mini stays in deep sleep, but is woken up by RTC once per minute via alarm interrupt to take temperature readings.

Readings stored in EEPROM IC.

E-ink driver analog circuit is based on datasheet example and waveshare driver boards (see references folder).
