todo:

- verify battery connector polarity

- double check charger and fuel guage schematic reference

- ensure all i2c addresses are unique

- add buttons

- add touch points to break out boot/reset for esp32

- add power switch, or soft power button solution

- verify that powerpath is not turned off by sysoff when vin/usb is connected (data sheet seems to indicate it only disconnects the battery)

- add voltage 5v to 3.3v voltage divider to allow esp32 to detect usb presence and indicate that the device is charging. (unless powerpath selector somehow indicates this)
I forget what the "charge" pin is for. Maybe that solves the problem?
